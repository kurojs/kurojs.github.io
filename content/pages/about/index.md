_Dream is not what you see when you sleep. Dream is what does not let you sleep._

### About Me

As a software engineer, I have a passion for reading about programming languages, coding, technology, system design, algorithms, and data structures.

### Why I Write This Blog?

- Public Learning: I was inspired by this article [Learn in Public](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/9720bd4a30606ca3ffb8d407113c0fe5).
- Sharing: When you learn something yourself, only you can know it. That's why I want to share what I have learned with everyone.
- And why we can't create something that I can share with others about my mistakes and lessons learned during my career.

### What I Will Write About?

- Everything I can imagine, including topics like Golang, backend development, algorithms, my working experiences, interview tips, and more.

#### _Thank you for reading and have a great day!_
